# Instant-Library
A mobile library

A mobile application that keeps track of your list of books. This project is still in development but its core features are working. Using an textfile as the Booklist the app is able to load the list, add books to the list, delete a book from the list and save you newly changes to the list. Features like adding a series with its author and its corresponding books is one of the many filters in development.

==NOTICE==
There is an error in the procedure that load the details to the array. I switched to Delphi 12 from Delphi 11 and now the pre-built function in deplhi does not work properly. The LoadFromFile does not load the textfile content, it instead reads the textfiles name. If you have a solution please help.
